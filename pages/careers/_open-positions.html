    <h4>About this role</h4>
    <p>Gruntwork has built a $5M+ ARR business serving 300 customers with zero outside capital by building the best way in the world to create a
      DevOps foundation. Now we're ready to take 3 key products to the next level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gruntwork Library</li>
      <li>Gruntwork Pipelines</li>
      <li>Gruntwork Reference Architecture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is an opportunity to develop new product paradigms, work with customers at both leading-edge startups and
      name-brand enterprises, and to make significant impact by enabling these products to reach their full potential.
      You'll do this by working directly with the founders, our head of product design, and a highly skilled engineering team.</p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork Library.</strong>
        You will be the owner of our core product,
        <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library" target="_blank">Gruntwork Library</a>,
        a collection of DevOps best practices that includes nearly 300 reusable, battle-tested, production-grade infrastructure
        modules for AWS written in Terraform, Go, Bash, and Python. We are ready to re-imagine this product as a next-generation
        way to deliver best practices from our DevOps experts to thousands of end users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork Pipelines.</strong>
        You'll also be the owner of <a href="/pipelines" target="_blank">Gruntwork Pipelines</a>, which configures
        off-the-shelf CI systems like GitHub Actions and GitLab to function as a secure and streamlined GitOps infrastructure
        pipeline. We see an opportunity to develop this product to drive significantly more customer value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork Reference Architecture.</strong>
        Finally, you'll be the owner of <a href="/reference-architecture" target="_blank">Gruntwork Reference Architecture</a>,
        an opinionated, end-to-end tech stack built on top of Gruntwork Library that we can deploy into a customer's AWS
        accounts in just days. You'll be responsible for defining the next-generation way that customers
        deploy new architectures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Product synergies.</strong>
        Each of these products makes the other more valuable. A key part of your work will be finding the high-leverage
        connection points that can drive outsize impact for the Gruntwork product portfolio as a whole.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drive our product management practices.</strong>
        Help improve how we build products as a company by streamlining all of our product management processes,
        including setting the product strategy, managing the road map, user testing, user story mapping, issue tracking,
        backlog grooming, sprint planning and execution, customer research, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Work alongside engineering and design.</strong>
        You'll serve as one member of a "trio" that includes an engineering manager and product designer.
        You'll collaborate with your colleagues on the vision, usability, and business viability of this new product,
        and take primary responsibility for our ability to execute. Further, you'll work directly with and report to
        our co-founder and Chief Product Officer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Work alongside customers.</strong>
        Working directly with customers to see how they use the product and putting in place product-driven improvements to
        support their success will be a key part of your role.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Product Ops.</strong>
        You have proven experience setting up a "product operating system" for your teams, including designing product management
        processes, leading meetings effectively, and setting a culture of continually making impact.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Product discovery.</strong>
        You have a proven ability for translating a chaotic cloud of possibilities into a concrete product strategy. You
        know how to query customers to get key insights. You can translate those insights into genuine innovation and a
        coherent and delightful product.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Product delivery.</strong>
        You have shipped many high-impact products in your time, enough to know the failure modes and the path to success.
        You have the experience to know what kind of process leads to shipping impactful work on a regular cadence.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Software engineering and/or DevOps expertise.</strong>
        To create products in our space, you must be able to quickly build a deep understanding of our domain:
        DevOps, AWS, cloud software, software delivery, CI/CD, and infrastructure as code. Prior experience in software
        engineering, working on dev tools, or other technical domains is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Values.</strong>
        You are inspired by <a href="/about/#our-values">our values</a>. Bonus points for a sense of humor, empathy,
        and curiosity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compatible time zones</h4>
    <p>
      You'll be working with a team in the <strong>US time zones</strong>, so you can be located in almost any
      country as long as your time zone is no further west than Los Angeles (GMT-8/GMT-7) and no further east than New
      York (GMT-5/GMT-4). We've found that when everyone on the team is located in similar time zones, it's easier to
      collaborate and there's much less pressure to stay up late or get up early, so this is a hard constraint, even if
      you're willing to work hours different from your current time zone.
    </p>
